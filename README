## Overview
  
This Java application displays an animation showing a scarecrow look to the left side and watching a red tractor riding on the road to the leaft with the beautiful weather on the back.

## Reflection

The project is fun and chalenging for me. There were man difficults I have run into while working with this project. One of the most challenging is making sure my scene adjust appropriately when the window gets resized. 

After this project I have learned a valuable lesson. This is I should assign proper coordinate at first by connect with width and height of the windown. 

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac TrafficAnimation.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java TrafficAnimation
```
